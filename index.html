	<h1> My life in a Paragraph </h1>
	<p> Hello, my name is Sucely. I know, I know super interesting name, most people butcher my name but after 28 years of it and I got used to it.  I am Guatemalan born and raised there until the age of 6. I don't remember much except how delicious the food is! In 1996 my family and I moved to Daly City (a city near San Francisco). I loved the bay area so much, it was very different from Guatemala, I had no idea what a functioning working toilet was until we moved to the United States! Gross I know, but can't complain life was just getting better for my young self. Fast forward 2015 my family and I did another big move but this time it was to Los Angeles. We moved in the middle of the summer, and lets just say the heat gave me migraines until the age of 20 (finally a little under control, well so i thought). I graduated from high school in 2009, went to a community college for about a year while working part-time. My mom was diagnosed with Lupus and I had to start working full time. I thought part-time school could work out but it did not. I dropped out in 2010, started working at a law firm. In 2012 my mom passed away, and a year later I gave birth to my first child. Funny how things happen in life. My daughter is a carbon copy of me. It's a little scary how much she looks and acts like me. It was a struggle to be a single mother in my early 20s but somehow I got through it. My daughter, Lily, she is now 5 and in kindergarten and life is just getting easier as she gets older. Lily and I moved to Las Vegas in July 2018 in hopes of changing my career path to a better much successful one.
